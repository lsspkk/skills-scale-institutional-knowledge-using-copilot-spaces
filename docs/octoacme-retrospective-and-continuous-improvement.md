# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Owner:
- Due date:
- Success criteria:

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
- Review process documentation effectiveness (including risk management, stakeholder communication, and change control)
- Update templates based on team feedback

## Role-Specific Retrospective Focus

### Risk Manager
- Were risks identified early enough?
- Was mitigation effective?
- Should risk assessment criteria be adjusted?

### Stakeholder Liaison
- Were stakeholders appropriately informed?
- Was feedback captured and acted upon?
- Should communication frequency or format change?

### Change Control Coordinator
- Were changes managed smoothly?
- Did the change process help or hinder progress?
- Should approval thresholds be adjusted?
