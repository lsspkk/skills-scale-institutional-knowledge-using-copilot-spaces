# OctoAcme — Project Initiation Guide

## Purpose
Define the initial steps to validate and authorize work, align stakeholders, and create a lightweight plan.

## When to use
Whenever a new project idea or feature proposal is ready to be explored.

## Goals
- Confirm business need and measurable outcome
- Identify stakeholders & champions
- Define success criteria and initial timeline
- Decide go/no-go for planning

## Minimum Deliverables
- Project One-pager (Problem, Goal, Success Metrics)
- Stakeholder list & communication plan
- High-level timeline and key milestones
- Initial risk list
- Resource needs (team roles, rough effort estimate)

## Project One-pager Template
- Project name:
- Problem statement:
- Objective / Goal (SMART):
- Success metrics:
- Primary stakeholders:
- Suggested timeline / milestones:
- Quick risks & dependencies:
- Proposed team / roles:

## Initiation Checklist
- [ ] One-pager completed and reviewed by Product Lead
- [ ] Sponsor / Stakeholder alignment (email or meeting)
- [ ] Stakeholder mapping completed (use `octoacme-stakeholder-communication-template.md`)
- [ ] Initial risk assessment performed (use `octoacme-risk-management-template.md`)
- [ ] Key roles assigned (PM, PdM, Risk Manager, Stakeholder Liaison as needed)
- [ ] Decision: Approve to move into planning?
- [ ] Create repo or project board skeleton
- [ ] Add initial artifacts to repo (docs/ or .copilot/)

## Decision Gate
Move to planning when:
- Success metrics are clear
- Stakeholders agree on priority
- Team availability is confirmed
- Initial risks identified and mitigation strategies outlined
- Communication plan established with Stakeholder Liaison

## Cross-Functional Coordination
- **Risk Manager:** Begin initial risk identification during one-pager development
- **Stakeholder Liaison:** Map stakeholders and establish communication plan early
- **Change Control Coordinator:** Set expectations for how changes will be managed

*See `octoacme-roles-and-personas.md` for detailed role responsibilities.*
