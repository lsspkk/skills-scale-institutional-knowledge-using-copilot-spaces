# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

## Core Roles
- **Project Manager (PM):** Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications.
- **Product Manager (PdM):** Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- **Developers:** Implement features, collaborate on design and testability.
- **QA/Testing:** Validate quality and acceptance criteria.
- **Stakeholders:** Provide inputs and approvals.

## Specialized Roles (for complex projects)
- **Risk Manager:** Oversees risk identification, assessment, and mitigation; maintains Risk Register.
- **Stakeholder Liaison:** Acts as communication bridge between project team and stakeholders.
- **Change Control Coordinator:** Manages evaluation and approval of scope, process, or requirement changes.

*See `octoacme-roles-and-personas.md` for detailed role descriptions and collaboration points.*

## Key Artifacts
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

## Lifecycle (high-level)
1. Initiation: problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline.
2. Planning: scope, resources, milestones, dependencies.
3. Execution: build, test, review, iterate.
4. Release: deploy, verify, announce.
5. Close & Retrospective: capture learnings and next steps.

## Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed

## How to use these docs
- Keep the Project Charter updated in the project repo.
